# E-moodles
In this project, we create a pug-in to Moodle site. 
This plug-in connects the Moodle forum with the account mail of the student or lecturer. 
The E-Moodles require the address of the course in the format: <mail-address>+<num-coruse>.<forum-num>@gmail.com. 
The mail Address is mail that the specific university that connects the plug-in is created,
example: Ariel_University+12.6@gmail.com.   
Take a look at our video that represents the user side: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXYRmv0WJvY.
